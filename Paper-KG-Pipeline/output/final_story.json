  "title": "Accelerated MRI Reconstruction via Autoregressive Image Diffusion and Efficient Posterior Sampling",
  "abstract": "Accelerated MRI reconstruction aims to recover high-fidelity images from undersampled k-space data, a task often limited by slow iterative optimization. We propose the Autoregressive Image Diffusion (AID) model, which reframes MRI reconstruction as a sequential image generation problem. Unlike static diffusion models, AID captures complex dependencies within image sequences, making it ideal for dynamic or volumetric MRI. To bridge the gap between generative quality and clinical feasibility, we integrate an exponential integrator sampler into the AID framework. This approach drastically reduces the number of function evaluations required for posterior sampling, enabling rapid synthesis without compromising structural integrity. Our method effectively samples the posterior distribution of the MRI, leveraging the autoregressive structure to maintain coherence across the sequence while significantly accelerating the reconstruction process.",
  "problem_framing": "We reframe accelerated MRI reconstruction from a traditional inverse problem of de-aliasing static images to a challenge of efficient high-dimensional sequence generation. While diffusion models offer superior generative potential for modeling complex posteriors, their application in clinical settings is hindered by prohibitive computational costs. The core challenge lies not just in modeling the distribution, but in sampling from it efficiently enough to be viable for time-sensitive medical workflows.",
  "gap_pattern": "Existing methods for MRI reconstruction using diffusion models fail because they treat the sampling process as a generic, computationally expensive stochastic simulation, often requiring thousands of steps. Current approaches either ignore the sequential nature of MRI data, leading to temporal incoherence, or rely on slow isotropic diffusion processes that cannot efficiently handle the high-dimensional posterior sampling required for real-world acceleration factors. This gap prevents the adoption of powerful generative models for practical, high-speed MRI reconstruction.",
  "solution": "We introduce the Autoregressive Image Diffusion (AID) model to generate coherent image sequences and apply it to sample the posterior for accelerated MRI. To overcome the latency barrier, we implement a Diffusion Exponential Integrator Sampler (DEIS) within the AID framework. By leveraging the semilinear structure of the diffusion process, this method minimizes discretization error and allows for high-fidelity reconstruction with significantly fewer denoising steps. This solution transforms the posterior sampling process into a rapid, deterministic-like procedure that respects the autoregressive dependencies of the image sequence, effectively accelerating MRI reconstruction while maintaining diagnostic quality.",
